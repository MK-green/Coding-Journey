# Coding Journey

This repository documents my 9-month journey to learn coding and Stanford CS fundamentals, guided by xAI's Grok 3. It contains Python programs created day by day, showcasing my growth from basics to more complex concepts.

 ## Projects
- **Day 10: Age and Student Checker**  
  A Python program that asks for a user's age and student status, uses conditionals and error handling to print custom messages. Demonstrates logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and input validation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/MK-green/Coding-Journey.git
2. 2. Navigate to the folder:
3. Run a Python file (e.g., Day 10): python Day 10 Age and Student Checker with error handling.py

## Future Plans
- Add more daily coding challenges (loops, functions, data structures).
- Refactor early programs for optimization.
- Include a portfolio page linking to my best projects by Month 9.
